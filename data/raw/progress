#+title: Progress

1. From Oricon database, a certain website holds all top manga
2. Crawl through the website for all the links
3. Create a dictionary of the years corresponding to the links with the weekly data (contains {year} and "weekly")
4. Dispose of all other urls and create that as first .csv
5. Create a test scraping for the first url
6. Expand for all urls, creating a seperate .csv for each url
7. Merge all .csv files together for the complete charts
8. Clean up the titles and create a seperate .csv for scraping/api usage
9. Use MAL api
   1. Holy moly it sucks so bad. I can't find a single correct ID.
    New plan: use AniList API to get the ID .... Or just use AniList or Anidb
   2. Plan 2; use anilist, learn how to use graphQL API request
   3. Maybe transfer using idMal to get MAL info? not sure yet
      1. First step first, I need to learn GraphQL,
         get some requests in from AniList
      2. Maybe transfer it to MAL
10. New thing; got all manga and anime from api requests anilist. Took around 3 hours with that many listings. Worry: I'm concerned about part 2 or part 3 of an anime... not sure what to do about that.
    1. Just got all anime and manga... there are some issues but got all data I think
